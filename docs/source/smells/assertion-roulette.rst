Assertion Roulette
=====================

*Definition:* Occurs when a test method has multiple non-documented assertions. 

*Consequences:* Multiple assertion statements in a test method without a descriptive message impacts readability/understandability/maintainability 
as itâ€™s not possible to understand the reason for the failure of the test.

*Detection:* A test method contains more than one assertion statement without without an explanation/message (parameter in the assertion method).

*Refactoring:*

  * Split the non-documented assertions into different methods
  * Add a 3rd parameter in the assertions with a message
  * Add a comment-block explaining the assertions
  
*Example:*
