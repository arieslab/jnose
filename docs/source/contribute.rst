Contributing to development

If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Read the Docs, then first get the project installed locally according to the
:doc:`installation guide </development/install>`. After that is done we suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled `Good
First Issue`_. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and won't put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.

If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope, then there are a set of tickets with a `Feature`_ or `Improvement`_ tag.
These tickets have a general overview and description of the work required to finish.
If you want to start somewhere, this would be a good place to start (make sure that the issue also have the `Accepted`_ label).
