Contributing
-------------

*Suggesting new ideas*

Please create a new topic on GitHub discussions <https://github.com/arieslab/jnose/discussions/categories/ideas>`_ to request a new feature. Even if you plan to implement it yourself and submit it back to the project, we would like to know what feature you are working on!

*File bug reports*

If you see something, say something (about bugs)! Please file an issue on the GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/arieslab/jnose/issues>`_. No quirk is too small for a report. We care about the details.

*Make our documentation better*

Did you learn how to do something in JNose Test but it wasn't obvious on first try? You can contribute to our documentation!
While the JNose Test documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs, the code is available in the `docs module<https://github.com/arieslab/jnose/tree/main/docs>`_ on the GitHub repository.

*Tackling some open issues*

If you want to deep dive and help out with development on JNose Test, we suggest you have a look at the tickets in the GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/arieslab/jnose/issues>`_.

*How to submit a change?*
Create a fork of our GitHub `repository <https://github.com/arieslab/jnose>`_, and push your changes to it. Then, you can open a Pull Request to contribute your changes upstream. Make sure to write some notes about what your change does!
